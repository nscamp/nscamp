Get in contact
==============

If you have any questions to do with the camp, and you'd like to get in contact with one of the organisers,
[send us an email](mailto:hack@nscamp.com).

If twitter is more your thing, you should [follow @nscamp_au](https:twitter.com/nscamp_au) and you can ping us there. Plus you'll be kept in the loop with NSCamp updates.
