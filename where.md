Where will the camp be held?
============================

We haven't yet organised a venue, as we want to try and gauge interest in the camp and then
based on interest decide how large a venue we need to find. 
If you're interested in the camp [you should register your interest](/register.html) 
so we can get an idea of numbers.

This is what we're planning on organising...

* The camp will be in the country side
* It will be located approximately 1hr drive from Melbourne
* Depending on demand, we may hire a bus to get everyone to and from the camp
* Accommodation will be modest, although we're not roughing it. Although if you wish to you can
* There will be power/electricity
* The weekend will be catered, if you have any dietary requirements, *please let us know*
