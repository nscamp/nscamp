Where will the camp be held?
============================

Yeah, we selected a camp.

It's the [Kinglake Ranges Wilderness Camp](http://www.krwc.com.au/) in Victoria, near Melbourne in Australia.

This is what we're planning on organising...

* The camp is in the country side
* It located approximately 50 min drive from Melbourne
* Depending on demand, we may hire a bus to get everyone to and from the camp or we will facilitate car pooling
* Accommodation is modest, although we're not roughing it. Although if you wish to you can
* There will be power/electricity
* The weekend will be catered, if you have any dietary requirements, *please let us know*
