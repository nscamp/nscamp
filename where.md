# Where will the camp be held?

Yeah, we selected a camp.

It's the [Kinglake Ranges Wilderness Camp](http://www.krwc.com.au/) in Victoria, near Melbourne in Australia.

Althought it's a camp it's not camping. The venue has beds and enough room for us to run our event.
The rooms are shared. If you like a bit more privacy you could bring a tent and pitch it. Not sure if we can sleep in the teepees (yes there are teepeees to match the logo).

Some facts:

* The camp is in the country side
* It located approximately 50 min drive from Melbourne
* We will facilitate car pooling
* Accommodation is modest, although we're not roughing it.
* There will be power/electricity
* The weekend will be catered, if you have any dietary requirements, *please let us know*
* There is WIFI. We will check it out before the event.
