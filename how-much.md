How much will the camp cost?
============================

We have put down a deposit for a camp in Kinglake in Victoria. Based on the price of the venue we think...

**the price will be around $300.**

This will cover the camp venue, food and cabins.

Lucky we got [REA](http://realestate.com.au) to [sponsor](/sponsors.html) the beer - so beer is free!
