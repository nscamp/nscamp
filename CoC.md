# Code of Conduct

### Be respectful

Respect others. Be courteous to those around
you. If someone indicates they don't wish to be photographed, respect
that wish. If someone indicates they would like to be left alone, let
them be. Our event venues and online spaces may be shared with members
of the public and employees of the venue; please be considerate to all
patrons of these locations.

### Be inclusive

All presentation material should be suitable for people aged 16 and
above.

Any public presentation which is part of any event, including but not
limited to presentations, lightning talks, recruiter/job position or
other promotions, mailing list posts and forums, is subject to this
code of conduct and thus may not contain:

---

<b>• sexual or violent imagery</b><br/>
<b>• exclusionary language</b><br/>
<b>• insults or ad-hominem attacks</b><br/>

---

Presenters are asked to avoid language which is not appropriate for an
all-ages audience as much as possible.

If the subject matter of the presentation cannot be presented
adequately without including language that could be considered
offensive, this should be pointed out in advance, at the beginning of
the talk and in the schedule.

If presenters are unsure whether their material is suitable, they are
encouraged to show it to an organiser before their session.

### Be aware

We ask everyone to be aware that we will not tolerate intimidation,
harassment, or any abusive, discriminatory or derogatory behaviour by
anyone at any event or online.

### What does that mean for me?

All participants, including event attendees and speakers must not
engage in any intimidation, harassment, or abusive or discriminatory
behaviour.

Here are some examples of behaviours that have occurred at tech events
which are not appropriate:

---

<b>• offensive verbal or written remarks related to gender, sexual orientation,
  disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion</b><br/>
<b>• sexual or violent images in public spaces (including presentation slides)</b><br/>
<b>• deliberate intimidation</b><br/>
<b>• stalking or following</b><br/>
<b>• unwanted photography or recording</b><br/>
<b>• sustained disruption of talks or other events</b><br/>
<b>• drunk or under the influence of illegal drugs at an event venue</b><br/>
<b>• physical contact without consent</b><br/>
<b>• unwelcome sexual attention</b><br/>
<b>• sexist, racist, or other exclusionary jokes</b><br/>
<b>• unwarranted exclusion from conference or related events based on
  age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
  race, religion</b><br/>

We want everyone to have a good time at NSCamp.
