Sponsor NSCamp
==============

Costs for food, beverages and *possibly internet* can mount up, 
so we're offering sponsorship opportunities for NSCamp. This is so we can keep the cost
of attending NSCamp at a reasonable level.

If your business is interested in sponsoring, there are a couple of different levels


Beer sponsorship
----------------
Coding is hard, so lets have a drink

* We (the organisers) will buy some kegs from a good local brewery
* Your company name and logo will be next to the beer bar "Beer sponsored by awesome company", and people will think you're awesome
* How much... $2,500

Food sponsorship
----------------
Coding makes me hungry, and this is where the food sponsorship will help

* The sponsorship money goes to buying food, and paying catering to cook it for us, and catering will do the washing up as well
* Your company name and logo will be next to kitchen "Food sponsored by awesome company", and people will think you're fantastic
  

Internet sponsorship
--------------------
There is code a library on the internet that you might need during the weekend

* Depending on the [venue](/where.html) we'll get some 3g/4g dongles for internet access, and some wifi gear for setting up a local network
* Your company name and logo will <strike>be on the internet</strike> in the hall where "Internet tubes sponsored by awesome company", and people will thank you providing them access to animated gifs
  
Coffee sponsorship
------------------
We don't know of any developers that don't like a coffee before coding

* Your sponsorship dollars will be spent on some <strike>good</strike> great quality beans and we'll hire a proper coffee machine. We nay also hire a barista, incase there aren't enough developers who fancy themselves as baristas
* Your company name and logo will be beside the coffee machine "Coffee sponsored by awesome company", plus people be grateful, as you saved them from a weekend without coffee. (just imagine that for a moment)
