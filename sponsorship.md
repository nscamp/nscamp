#Sponsor NSCamp

Costs for food, beverages and *possibly internet* can mount up, 
so we're offering sponsorship opportunities for NSCamp. This is so we can keep the cost
of attending NSCamp at a reasonable level. 

If your business is interested in reaching out to an elite group of iOS and OSX developers, download our [sponsor package (pdf)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2npjj92ut5qe6s7/NSCamp%20Sponsor%20Packages.pdf)
