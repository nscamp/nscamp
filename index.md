### Tickets:  [are now available  (AUD $300) ](https://nscamp.herokuapp.com/rego)


## What's going to happen there?

* You can code/hack
* Maybe you've been wanting to extract some code out into a library
* Work on some bugs fixes to a library you use
* Progress your side project
* Chill out and play with new stuff (e.g. iOS 7)
* **Or** maybe you just want to make some new friends in the iOS/OSX community.

Most importantly the atmosphere is social and supportive. 

You don't have to be a great coder to go.

Basically it is what [railscamp](http://railscamps.com) is for the ruby community.
