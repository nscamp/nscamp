About the camp
==============

A bunch of iOS developers had a couple of drinks in may and as a result we came up with NSCamp.
We want to organise an Apple developer weekend under the motto of...

"Social weekend meets hacking with like minded developers"

It looks like there is quite a bit of interest in a developer weekend and the people we talked to were pretty excited about it. So, we decided to put our hands up to organise the first NSCamp.

Although the exact location [isn't yet worked out](/where.html), NSCamp will be held near Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. 

What's going to happen there?
-----------------------------

* You can code/hack
* Maybe you've been wanting to extract some code out into a library
* Work on some bugs fixes to a library you use
* Progress your side project
* Chill out and play with new stuff (e.g. iOS 7)
  
  
**Or** maybe you just want to make some new friends in the iOS/OSX community.
Most importantly the atmosphere is social and supportive. 

You don't have to be a great coder to go.


Basically it is what [railscamp](http://railscamp.com) is for the ruby community.

  `NSCamp *camp = [[RailsCamp railsCamp] copy];`


So when it is going to happen and how many can attend?
