## iBeacon Lab 

* The guys form [jtribe Labs](http://jtribe.com.au) have some iBeacon gear organised and will give away some of it during the lab on Saturday. Hack and co-work on ideas and come out with some great prototypes.

## You workshop here?

* If you have something you want to present or run a workshop [let us know](mailto:hack@nscamp.com) and we will add it here...

## What's else is going to happen there?
* There will be a board with workshops and sessions that people can self-organise
* Progress your side project (maybe make it open source)
* You can code/hack on a project with others
* Work on some bugs fixes to a library you use
* Chill out and play with new stuff (e.g. iOS 7, iBeacon)
* **Or** maybe you just want to make some new friends in the iOS/OSX community.


Most importantly the atmosphere is social and supportive. 

You don't have to be a great coder to go.

Basically it is what [railscamp](http://railscamps.com) is for the ruby community.
