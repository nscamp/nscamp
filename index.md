* Work on some bugs fixes to a library you use
* Progress your side project
* Chill out and play with new stuff (e.g. iOS 7)
* **Or** maybe you just want to make some new friends in the iOS/OSX community.

## Special event

* [Mobile Couch](http://jellystyle.com/podcasts/mobilecouch) live podcast. The guys from Mobile Couch are doing a live podcast on Sunday. Check out their awesome [podcasts on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/mobile-couch/id599454382?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)


Most importantly the atmosphere is social and supportive. 

You don't have to be a great coder to go.

Basically it is what [railscamp](http://railscamps.com) is for the ruby community.
